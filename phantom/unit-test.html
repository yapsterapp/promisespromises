        This is just a dummy HTML file with which to load the unit tests.
        This file could be changed to include HTML for the tests to use
        during their operation.
        <script src="polyfill.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="unit-test-js/unit-test.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
